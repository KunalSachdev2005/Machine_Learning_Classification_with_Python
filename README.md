# ML Classification Algorithms to Predict Loan Defaults
Following data collection, wrangling, EDA, and feature selection/extraction, I build and evaluate
various Machine Learning Classification Algorithms like KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM,
and Decision Tree to determine the best model to predict whether a person pays off his/her
loan or goes into collection.
